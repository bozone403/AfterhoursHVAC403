---

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. **Alberta Rebate Calculator - Text Visibility** ✅
**Problem:** White text on light gradient background (from-green-50 to-blue-50) was completely invisible

**Fixed:**
- Changed all heading text from `text-white` to `text-gray-900`
- Updated subtext from `text-white/80` to `text-gray-700`
- Fixed label text from `text-white/90` to `text-gray-700 font-medium`
- Changed input backgrounds from transparent (`bg-white/5`) to solid white (`bg-white`)
- Updated input text from `text-white` to `text-gray-900`
- Fixed placeholder text from `text-white/40` to `text-gray-400`
- Updated borders from `border-white/20` to `border-gray-300`
- Changed focus styles to `focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-blue-500`
- Fixed results section text colors for Investment Breakdown and Savings Analysis
- Updated rebate cards background to `bg-gray-50` with proper text contrast

**Result:** All text is now clearly visible with proper contrast ratios

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/pages/tools/alberta-rebate-calculator.tsx`

**Commit:** `0fdbc24d`

### 2. **Stripe Payment Integration** ✅
**Problem:** Payment errors showing "Failed to initialize payment. Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"

**Root Cause:** Frontend calling `/api/create-payment-intent` but endpoint didn't exist, server returning HTML 404

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Created `/api/create-payment-intent` endpoint with proper Stripe integration
- ✅ Updated `/api/create-checkout-session` with real Stripe session creation (was just mock)
- ✅ Added Stripe library import to routes.ts
- ✅ Both endpoints check for `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and return helpful error if missing
- ✅ Proper amount conversion to cents (`Math.round(amount * 100)`)
- ✅ Correct Stripe API version: `2025-05-28.basil`
- ✅ Added `automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true }` for card payments
- ✅ Success/cancel URLs use request origin for proper redirects

**API Endpoints Created:**
```typescript
POST /api/create-payment-intent
Body: { amount, description, metadata }
Response: { clientSecret, paymentIntentId }

POST /api/create-checkout-session  
Body: { serviceName, price, description, category }
Response: { sessionId, url }
```

**Environment Variable Required:**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Must be added to production environment variables

**Files Modified:**
- `/server/routes.ts`

**Commit:** `dfc3770f`

### 3. **Admin Panel - User Role Management** ✅
**Problem:** Unable to change users to Pro or Admin status in admin panel

**Root Cause:**
1. GET endpoint only returned basic fields (id, username, email, role)
2. PUT route didn't exist (frontend uses PUT, backend only had PATCH)
3. Field name mismatch (frontend: `isAdmin`, `hasProAccess` | database: `is_admin`, `has_pro_access`)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Updated GET `/api/admin/users` to return ALL user fields with proper camelCase mapping:
  - `is_admin` → `isAdmin`
  - `has_pro_access` → `hasProAccess`
  - `first_name` → `firstName`
  - `last_name` → `lastName`
  - `user_type` → `userType`
  - `account_locked` → `accountLocked`
  - `created_at` → `createdAt`
  - `last_login` → `lastLogin`

- ✅ Created unified `updateUserHandler` function that supports both PATCH and PUT
- ✅ Added proper field mapping from frontend camelCase to database snake_case
- ✅ Registered both routes: `app.patch("/api/admin/users/:id")` and `app.put("/api/admin/users/:id")`

**Admin Panel Now Supports:**
- ✅ Toggle Pro Access (hasProAccess)
- ✅ Toggle Admin Privileges (isAdmin)
- ✅ Change user role
- ✅ Change user type
- ✅ Lock/unlock accounts
- ✅ Update profile fields (firstName, lastName, phone, email)

**Files Modified:**
- `/server/routes.ts`

**Commit:** `dfc3770f`

### 4. **Admin Panel - Team Members Management** ✅
**Problem:** No way to manage team members displayed on the About page

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added "Team Members" tab to admin dashboard
- ✅ Fetches team data from `/api/admin/team` endpoint
- ✅ Displays member photos, names, titles, and bios
- ✅ Shows active/inactive status with badges
- ✅ Shows display order
- ✅ Edit and Delete buttons ready for implementation
- ✅ Empty state with helpful message

**Backend Support:** Team CRUD methods already implemented in storage.ts:
- `getTeamMembers()`
- `getTeamMemberById(id)`
- `createTeamMember(member)`
- `updateTeamMember(id, data)`
- `deleteTeamMember(id)`

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/pages/admin-dashboard-enhanced.tsx`

**Commit:** `c6d48b60`

---

### 5. **Homepage Layout - Button Overlap** ✅
**Problem:** "Schedule Now" button overlaying Premium Feature Cards on mobile/tablet

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added proper z-index layering:
  - CTA buttons container: `relative z-20`
  - Premium Feature Cards: `relative z-10`
- ✅ Made buttons responsive:
  - Mobile: `w-full` (full width)
  - Desktop: `sm:w-auto` (auto width)
- ✅ Added proper spacing:
  - Cards: `mt-8 lg:mt-0` (margin-top on mobile, none on large screens)

**Result:** No more overlap, proper stacking on all screen sizes

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/pages/home-luxury.tsx`

**Commit:** `c6d48b60`

## 🔧 ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO ADDRESS

### Critical Remaining Issues:

#### 1. **Stripe Configuration in Production** ⚠️
**Action Required:**
- Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to production environment variables on Render.com
- Without this key, payment endpoints will return error: "Stripe is not configured"
- Get key from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

#### 2. **Forum Placeholder Text Visibility** 📝
**Status:** Needs investigation
- User reported placeholder text in forums not visible
- Need to check forum input components for contrast issues

#### 3. **Consistent Color Palette Site-Wide** 🎨
**Current State:** Mixed color schemes across pages
- Homepage: Blue/Amber gradient
- Tools pages: Various gradients
- Admin: Blue/Orange
- Services: Mixed

**Recommendation:** Establish brand color system:
- Primary: Blue (#2563eb to #1e40af)
- Accent: Amber (#f59e0b to #d97706)
- Success: Green (#10b981)
- Warning: Amber (#f59e0b)
- Danger: Red (#ef4444)
- Neutral: Gray scale

#### 4. **Service Request Flow Testing** 🧪
**Need to verify:**
- Service request forms actually submit
- Contact form sends data to database
- Email notifications working
- Admin receives service requests in dashboard

#### 5. **Team Member Edit/Delete Functionality** 👥
**Current:** Team tab shows members but edit/delete buttons don't work yet
**Next Step:** Implement mutation handlers for team member updates/deletions
