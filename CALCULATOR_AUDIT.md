## üéØ RECOMMENDED FIXES

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Fix Membership Nav Link**
   - Change `/membership-simple` ‚Üí `/membership` in Navbar

2. **Promote Enhanced Quote Builder**
   - Make it the PRIMARY material calculator
   - Add prominent link on /calculators page
   - Maybe rename "Advanced Material Calculator" to link to enhanced-quote-builder instead of pro-calculator

3. **Consolidate Calculators**
   - You have duplicate BTU calculators (btu, btu-calculator, pro-btu)
   - Decide which one is best and remove/redirect others
   - Same for quote builders (quote-builder vs enhanced-quote-builder)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **Test All Calculators**
   - Many calculators might not have real data
   - Verify they actually work and produce accurate results
   - Consider removing non-functional ones

5. **Add Tools Section**
   - You have great tools in /tools/* that aren't discoverable
   - Add a "Professional Tools" section or page
   - Link AI diagnoser, rebate calculator, etc.

### LOW PRIORITY

6. **Create Landing Pages**
   - Pro Portal needs better onboarding
   - Material calculators need explanations
   - Add "how to use" guides

## üí° SUGGESTIONS

### Option A: Simplify
- Keep ONLY Enhanced Quote Builder for materials

- **PRO:** Advanced features, templates, bulk pricing
