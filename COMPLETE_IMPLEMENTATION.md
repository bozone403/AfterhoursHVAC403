## 🔐 CRITICAL FIX: PRO MEMBERSHIP ACTIVATION

**THE PROBLEM:**
Users could pay for Pro membership ($49+) but the system never activated their Pro access. The payment would succeed, money would be collected, but the user wouldn't get Pro features.

**THE FIX:**
Added `/api/activate-pro` endpoint that:
1. Verifies user is authenticated
2. Updates database: `has_pro = 1`, `has_pro_access = 1`
3. Updates user session with new Pro status
4. Logs activation for tracking
5. Returns success confirmation

**THE IMPACT:**
- No more paying customers without Pro access
- No more refund requests due to activation issues
- Immediate Pro feature access after payment
- Revenue protection
