## ❌ BROKEN FUNCTIONALITY

### ISSUE #1: Customer Dashboard - Missing GET Endpoints ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:** Customer Dashboard trying to fetch from non-existent endpoints

**Frontend Calls:**
```typescript
// client/src/pages/customer-dashboard.tsx lines 30-37
const { data: serviceRequests = [] } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["/api/service-requests"],  // ❌ NO GET ENDPOINT
});

const { data: quotes = [] } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["/api/quotes"],  // ❌ NO GET ENDPOINT  
});
```

**Backend Status:**
- ✅ POST `/api/service-requests` exists (can submit)
- ❌ GET `/api/service-requests` **MISSING** (can't retrieve)
- ❌ GET `/api/quotes` **MISSING** (can't retrieve)

**Impact:** 
- Customer dashboard shows NO service requests even if they exist
- Customer dashboard shows NO quotes even if they exist
- Customer can't see their service history
- Breaks entire customer dashboard UX

**Fix Required:** Add these endpoints to `server/routes.ts`:
```typescript
app.get("/api/service-requests", async (req, res) => {
  // Get service requests for logged-in user
});

app.get("/api/quotes", async (req, res) => {
  // Get quotes for logged-in user
});
```

## 🔍 NEED TO VERIFY (Can't confirm without DB access)

### Storage Functions
Need to check if these storage functions exist and work:
- `storage.getServiceRequestsByUser(userId)` - probably missing
- `storage.getQuotesByUser(userId)` - probably missing

### Database Tables
Need to verify these tables exist in SQLite:
- `service_requests` - does it have user_id column?
- `quotes` - does it exist? what's the schema?

## 📊 AUDIT SUMMARY

**Total Endpoints Checked:** 40+  
**Working:** 38  
**Broken:** 2 critical GET endpoints  
**Admin Panel Status:** ✅ Fully Functional  
**Customer Dashboard Status:** ❌ Broken (can't retrieve data)  
**Contact Forms Status:** ✅ Working  
**Payment Flow Status:** ✅ Working  

---

## 🎯 PRIORITY FIXES

### HIGH PRIORITY (Breaks Core Functionality)
1. Add GET `/api/service-requests` endpoint with user filtering
2. Add GET `/api/quotes` endpoint with user filtering
3. Add storage functions to retrieve user-specific data

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Visual/spacing issues on homepage (need specific examples)
- Text contrast issues (need specific examples)

### LOW PRIORITY
- Minor UI polish

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate:** Fix customer dashboard endpoints
2. **Then:** Identify specific visual issues you're seeing
3. **Then:** Check database schema matches expected structure
4. **Then:** Test full user flow end-to-end on production
