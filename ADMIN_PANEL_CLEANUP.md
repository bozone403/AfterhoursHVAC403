# ADMIN PANEL CONTINUITY AUDIT

## Issues Found:

1. **Duplicate "Manage Team" button** - Top of page has button that links to `/admin/team`
2. **Team Members tab** - Has redirect but confusing UX  
3. **Duplicate Service Bookings tabs** - Lines 1058 and 1204
4. **No actual team management in dashboard** - Should just link out

## Fixes Needed:

1. Remove "Manage Team" button from header (redundant with tab)
2. Keep Team tab but make it a proper redirect card
3. Remove first duplicate bookings tab
4. Ensure all mutations work properly

## Tabs Should Be:
1. **Users** - Create, edit, delete users ✅
2. **Team** - Link to /admin/team (dedicated page) ✅  
3. **Job Applications** - Review applications ✅
4. **Service Bookings** - Manage bookings ✅
5. **Contact Messages** - View messages ✅
6. **Emergency Requests** - Manage emergencies ✅
7. **Forum** - Moderate posts ✅
